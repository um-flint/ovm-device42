This code will read info about servers and VMs from Oracle VM Manager using REST and then send the data back to Device42.

It can be run with './ovm-device42.py' and expects a config file in the same directory named 'ovm-device42.cfg'

It was written on a Mac with Python 2.7

I have tested it against Oracle VM Manager 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.  I suspect it would also work with Oracle VM Manager 3.4.1.
